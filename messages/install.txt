This plugin will try to open Sublime Text file paths found on
selections/cursor when pressing "ALT+D". Supports files with the same
extension by default but can be configured via settings to work with special
file naming conventions (like scss includes). See below.

Strings starting with http:// or https:// will open with default browser if
binary, or we will read the file with urllib and open the result in a new
view. By setting the `open_http_in_browser` setting in your user preferences
to `true`, we will *always* open the default browser.

`use_strict` preference will control if the path should be complete and
correct, if not the file will not open and the package will not attempt to
find the file.

`auto_extension` preference can be used to specify special file naming
conventions (like scss includes).
